### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

  - Progress dashboard with charts  
  - Routing between pages  
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - Login
  - Calculating daily calorie goals  
  - Saving/loading workout and weight data  
  - Getting progress history
